## Core Features & Functionalities

<span style="font-size:1.05em; font-weight:bold;">
      This section highlights the key technical features and app-wide capabilities that enhance performance, usability, and user experience.
</span>

<br>

### Mobile Responsive Design

The entire website is built to be mobile-friendly and adapts seamlessly to smartphones.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/responsive.png" width="850" alt="Responsive Home Page Preview"/>
</p>

<br>

### Adaptive Theme Toggle: Dark & Light Modes

The application supports both dark and light themes, automatically adjusting based on the user's system preferences. Users can manually toggle the theme as well, ensuring a comfortable experience in any lighting condition.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/dark_mode.png" width="49%" alt="Dark Theme Example"/>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/light_mode.png" width="49%" alt="Light Theme Example"/>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/responsive_theme_toggle.jpg" width="59%" alt="Responsive Theme Toggle UI"/>
</p>

> **Note:** <br>
>
> The theme toggle [**_logic_**](./src/components/ui/ThemeToggle/useThemeToggle.js) and [**_implementation_**](./src/components/ui/ThemeToggle/ThemeToggle.jsx) details can be found in the source code.

<br>

### Toast, Alert & Confirmation Notifications

To provide quick and meaningful feedback to users, the application uses two libraries for notifications:

* [`react-toastify`](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) ‚Äî for non-blocking toast messages (e.g., success/error feedback).
* [`SweetAlert2`](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) ‚Äî for modal alerts (e.g., confirmation dialogs, warnings).

These tools are used throughout the app to improve user interaction and enhance the overall UX.

You‚Äôll find examples of them in action in the following sections:

* ‚úÖ [Email Verification](#email-verification)
* ‚úÖ [Forgot Password](#forgot-password)
* ‚úÖ [Private Routes](#private-routes)
* ‚úÖ [Role Based Routes](#role-based-routes)
* ‚úÖ [Payment Methods](#payment-methods)


<br>

### Custom Cursor & Scrollbar

Custom animated cursor and styled scrollbar for enhanced aesthetics (desktop only).

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/cursor_and_scrollbar.png" width="850" alt="Custom Cursor and Scrollbar Demo"/>
</p>

<br>

### Custom Skeleton Loaders

The app features fully customized skeleton loaders tailored to the UI design, providing smooth and visually consistent loading placeholders throughout the application. These loaders improve perceived performance and maintain user engagement during data fetching on various pages and components.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/skeleton-1.gif" width="850" alt="Skeleton Loader Example 1"/>

</p>

<br>

### Installable PWA Button

A floating `üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Install the App` button appears briefly at intervals and fades out to reduce distraction. Users can install the _Progressive Web App (PWA)_ to their home screen for a native-app-like experience.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/pwa.gif" width="850" alt="Installable PWA Button Demo"/>
</p>

> **Note:** <br>
>
> The progressive web app [**_logic and implementation_**](./src/components/ui/InstallPWAButton.jsx) details can be found in the source code.

<br>

### Dynamic Content Suggestions (YouTube API Integration)

Videos are dynamically fetched from YouTube using the YouTube Data API based on the selected bike type. Logged-in users can personalize results via a dropdown. A responsive carousel layout ensures smooth viewing, with fallback videos shown if API data isn‚Äôt available..

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/yt_api.gif" width="850" alt="YouTube API Integration Demo"/>
</p>

> **Note:** <br>
>
> The YouTube API integration [**_logic_**](./src/hooks/useYouTubeSearch.js) and [**_implementation_**](./src/pages/Home/BikeHacks/BikeHacks.jsx#L20-L94) details can be found in the source code.

<br>

### Email System

This site supports transactional email notifications (such as enrollment confirmations and payment receipts) for users. This feature is implemented on the [_server_](https://github.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Server) side.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/mail.png" width="850" alt="Transactional Email Example"/>

-   A success message is shown after registration, instructing users to check their email for the verification link.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** <br>
>
> Check your inbox for the email verification link. If it doesn‚Äôt arrive within a few minutes, check your _Spam_ or _Junk folder_.

<br>

##### Forgot Password

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/forgot_password.png" width="850" alt="Forgot Password UI"/>
</p>

-   Users can reset their password by clicking **_`Forgot password?`_** and entering their registered email.

-   Provides real-time password strength feedback, showing which criteria (uppercase, numbers, special characters, minimal length) are met. The confirm password field and submit button remain disabled until all requirements are fulfilled.

<br>

##### Password Reset Email Notification

Users receive this email with a secure link to reset or set their password after initiating either `Forgot password` or `Create a password` from their dashboard.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/password_reset_mail.png" width="850" alt="Password Reset Email Example"/>
</p>

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** <br>
>
> Check your inbox for the password reset link. If it doesn‚Äôt arrive within a few minutes, check your _Spam_ or _Junk folder_.

<br>

</p>

<br>

#### Access Control

The application enforces strict access control with protected routes and role-based permissions.

##### Private Routes

`Dashboard` and `instructors' wall` are protected routes and only accessible to authenticated users (requires signing in). Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the login page.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/private-route.gif" width="850" alt="Private Route Redirect Demo"/>
</p>

_This GIF demonstrates an unauthenticated user being redirected to the login page when attempting to access a private route, and then being redirected back to the intended page after successful login._

<br>

##### Role Based Routes

Some routes are further restricted based on user roles (e.g., only instructors can access course creation pages, only students can access payment pages). Unauthorized users are redirected and shown an appropriate message.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tanzeebul-Tamim/MTB-Coaching-Client/refs/heads/assets/doc/role-route.gif" width="850" alt="Role Based Route Redirect Demo"/>
